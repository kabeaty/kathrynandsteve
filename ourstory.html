    <h2>We Met on March 15, 2012</h2>
    <p>It was the foreboding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ides_of_March">Ides of March</a> during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_by_Southwest">South by Southwest festival</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditorium_Shores">Auditorium Shores</a> in downtown Austin, Texas, and the band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shins">The Shins</a> were playing a show. Kathryn attended the show with her friend Rose Mathies, and Steve was there with his friend Jeff Hussmann. We became friends after this and got to know each other better for nine months, until we began dating in December 2015.</p>

    <p>Every year to celebrate the anniversary of when we started dating, Steve and I have gone to a different bed-and-breakfast in the Texas hill country. This picture is from the first year we did this, when we stayed in Fredericksburg. We'd just finished our tour of the Garrison Brothers Distillery and are tasting the bourbon.</p>

    <p>On Sunday, December 20, 2015, Steve suggested that we go for a walk around Town Lake in downtown Austin. We got engaged at Auditorium Shores in the same place where we first met, almost four years earlier.</p>
