    <h2>We met on March 15, 2012</h2>
    <p>It was the foreboding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ides_of_March">Ides of March</a> during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_by_Southwest">South by Southwest festival</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditorium_Shores">Auditorium Shores</a> in downtown Austin, Texas, and the band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shins">The Shins</a> were playing a show. Kathryn attended the show with her friend Rose Mathies, and Steve was there with his friend Jeff Hussmann. We became friends after this and got to know each other better for nine months, until we began dating in December 2015.</p>

    <h2>We both grew up in Pennsylvania</h2>

    <p>Both Kathryn and Steve lived in farmhouses as kids, as well--Kathryn in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York,_Pennsylvania">York, Pennsylvania</a> and Steve in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erie,_Pennsylvania">Erie, Pennsylvania</a>. The cities are on opposite sides of the state, but they're similar in many ways. Both are bucolic with winding and hilly roads, near the Amish, and host large fairs each fall.</p>

    <h2>We enjoy live music and beer</h2>

    <p>One of our shared interests is music, including attending live shows. Here we are at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_City_Limits_Music_Festival">Austin City Limits Music Festival</a> in 2013. Including music festivals, we've attended shows of hundreds of bands together. Some of our top shows together were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufjan_Stevens">Sufjan Stevens</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Cave_and_the_Bad_Seeds">Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtney_Barnett">Courtney Barnett</a>.</p>

    <p>Every year to celebrate the anniversary of when we started dating, Steve and I have gone to a different bed-and-breakfast in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Hill_Country">Texas Hill Country</a>. This picture is from the first year we did this, when we stayed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredericksburg,_Texas">Fredericksburg</a>. We'd just finished our tour of the <a href="http://www.garrisonbros.com/">Garrison Brothers Distillery</a> and are tasting the bourbon. We'll probably start doing an annual getaway on our wedding anniversary in the future instead.</p>

    <h2>We travelled to Peru in 2015</h2>
    <p>We went to Peru for two weeks at the end of August in 2015. This was our first international trip together. We spent one week in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cusco">Cusco</a> and one week in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iquitos">Iquitos</a>, staying in a jungle lodge on the Amazon.</p>

    <p>On Sunday, December 20, 2015, Steve suggested that we go for a walk around Town Lake in downtown Austin. We got engaged at Auditorium Shores in the same place where we first met, almost four years earlier. Here's a picture of us newly engaged.</p>
